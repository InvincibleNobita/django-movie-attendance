Designing and implementing a web application of your own with Python and JavaScript

### Overview

The final project is your opportunity to design and implement a demonstrable project of your own. So long as your project draws upon the basics of Django & REST APIs that may be fruitful to the role, the nature of your project will be entirely up to you.

### Requirements

In this project, you are asked to build a web application of your own. The nature of the application is up to you, subject to a few requirements:
- Your application much have at least three self-created models and its related views.
- Your web application must utilize Django (including at least one model) on the back end and JavaScript on the front-end.
- Your web application must be mobile-responsive.
- In a README.md in your project’s main directory, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file you created, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project. This file should also provide your justification for why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements, mentioned above.
- If you’ve added any Python packages that need to be installed in order to run your web application, be sure to add them to a requirements.txt file!

> Beyond these requirements, the design, look, and feel of the website are up to you!
